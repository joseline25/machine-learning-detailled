 load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('adult.csv')


1 - How does naive bayes work? (assumptions )

2 - What type of model can we build with naive bayes? (predict/classification)

['age', 'workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'educational_num',
    'marital_status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'gender',
    'capital_gain', 'capital_loss', 'hours_per_week', 'native_country']


We have two classes of incomes: '<=50K' or '>50K'

'<=50K' : low income == 0
'>50K' : high income == 1
