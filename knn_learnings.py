"""

The nearest neighbors method (k-Nearest Neighbors, or k-NN)
is another very popular classification method that is also sometimes
used in regression problems. This, like decision trees, is one of the 
most comprehensible approaches to classification. The underlying 
intuition is that you look like your neighbors. More formally, 
the method follows the compactness hypothesis: if the distance 
between the examples is measured well enough, then similar 
examples are much more likely to belong to the same class.





About dataset

Imagine a telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base
by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups.
If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company
can customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a 
classification problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels,
we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.
The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, 
and marital, to predict usage patterns. The target field, called custcat,
has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups,
as follows: 

1- Basic Service 
2- E-Service 
3- Plus Service
4- Total Service 

Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases.
We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
